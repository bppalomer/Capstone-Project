            <p>Q: What is a Privacy Policy?</p>
            <p>A: A Privacy Policy is a legal document that explains how an organization collects, uses, discloses, and protects the personal information of individuals.

        <p>Q: Why do websites need a Privacy Policy?</p>
        <p>A: Websites collect various types of personal information from their users, such as names, email addresses, and browsing behavior. A Privacy Policy is required by law in many jurisdictions to inform users about the data being collected, how it will be used, who it will be shared with, and what rights users have regarding their data. It helps build trust with users by being transparent about data practices and privacy protection.</p>

Depending on the nature of your business and the types of data collected, you may need to include additional clauses or details in your Privacy Policy to address unique circumstances.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Q: How can users access or update their personal information?</p>
        <p>A: A Privacy Policy should provide information on how users can access, modify, or delete their personal information.

Users may be required to verify their identity before any changes are made to their personal information.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Q: Can a Privacy Policy change over time?</p>
        <p>A: Yes, a Privacy Policy can change over time, especially if there are updates to data practices or legal requirements.
